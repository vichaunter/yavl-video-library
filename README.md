Local folders video browser for your own collection that shows all your videos in an interface similar to trakt.

- Based on electron-react
- It works also in windows
- Can open network mapped folders

### Notice

My main idea was to make it easy to choose anything i have in my drive, and also know what i've already seen, all in a fancy and visual way

    yarn


## Distribuable package
